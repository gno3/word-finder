# Tasks: Mobile Responsiveness and UI Polish

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-responsiveness-and-polish/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT requested for this feature - focus on implementation and manual validation

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **React web app**: `src/` for source code, `public/` for static assets, `tests/` for test files
- Component organization: `src/components/`, `src/pages/`, `src/hooks/`
- TypeScript types: `src/types/`, services: `src/services/`, utilities: `src/utils/`
- Paths shown below assume React project structure as per constitution

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and responsive design foundation

- [x] T001 Verify viewport meta tag configuration in public/index.html
- [x] T002 [P] Update Tailwind CSS configuration: verify breakpoints (sm:640px, md:768px, lg:1024px), add touch target utilities (min-h-11, min-w-11), ensure responsive font scales
- [x] T003 [P] Create responsive utility functions in src/utils/responsive.ts

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core responsive infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T004 Create useViewport custom hook in src/hooks/useViewport.ts
- [x] T005 [P] Create responsive TypeScript types in src/types/responsive.ts
- [x] T006 [P] Create touch target validation utilities in src/utils/touchTargets.ts
- [x] T007 Update existing TypeScript types in src/types/wordFilter.ts for reset functionality

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Mobile Word Filtering (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Deliver comprehensive mobile responsiveness across 320px-768px viewports with proper touch targets and readable text

**Independent Test**: Access application on mobile device (320px-768px width), create segments with touch inputs, successfully filter words with readable results

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T008 [P] [US1] Enhance SegmentInput component with mobile responsiveness in src/components/WordFilter/SegmentInput.tsx

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent but will integrate with responsive components from US1
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances components from US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Component enhancements can proceed in parallel where they affect different files
- Integration tasks depend on individual component completion
- Testing and validation happen after implementation tasks complete

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Component enhancements within each story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

```bash
# Launch responsive component enhancements in parallel:
Task: "Enhance SegmentInput component with mobile responsiveness in src/components/WordFilter/SegmentInput.tsx"
Task: "Update WordFilterForm component with mobile layout in src/components/WordFilter/WordFilterForm.tsx"
Task: "Enhance FilterResults component with responsive grid layout in src/components/WordFilter/FilterResults.tsx"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Mobile Responsiveness)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently on multiple mobile devices
5. Deploy/demo mobile-responsive version

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Responsive foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test mobile responsiveness independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test reset functionality independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test accessibility compliance independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous functionality

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Mobile Responsiveness)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Reset Functionality) 
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Accessibility & Polish)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
