# Feature Specification: Mobile Responsiveness and UI Polish

**Feature Branch**: `004-responsiveness-and-polish`  
**Created**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Responsiveness and Polish. Test and adjust layout for common mobile viewport sizes (320px to 768px width). Ensure the app works well on mobile devices with proper touch targets and readable text sizes. Add a clear/reset button to remove all segments and results and start over. Style the app with a clean, minimal UI using CSS/Tailwind with good contrast and spacing"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Mobile Word Filtering (Priority: P1)

A user accesses the word finder application on their mobile device to create word segments and filter words while on the go. They need to easily interact with form controls, read text clearly, and navigate the interface using touch gestures.

**Why this priority**: Mobile traffic represents a significant portion of web usage, and the core functionality must work seamlessly on mobile devices for user retention and accessibility.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the application on a mobile device (320px-768px width), creating segments with touch inputs, and successfully filtering words with readable results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user accesses the app on a mobile device, **When** they view the segment input forms, **Then** all input fields are appropriately sized for touch interaction with minimum 44px touch targets
2. **Given** a user is viewing the app on a 320px wide screen, **When** they interact with the interface, **Then** all text remains readable at minimum 16px font size and content doesn't require horizontal scrolling
3. **Given** a user has created segments on mobile, **When** they view the results, **Then** the word grid adapts appropriately to narrow screens with proper spacing and readability

---

### User Story 2 - Quick Reset and Start Over (Priority: P2)

A user wants to quickly clear all their current segments and results to start a completely new word filtering session without manually removing each segment individually.

**Why this priority**: Provides essential workflow efficiency for users who want to experiment with different word patterns or start fresh, significantly improving user experience over manual deletion.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating multiple segments with results, clicking the reset button, and verifying all segments and results are cleared with the interface returning to initial state.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has multiple segments configured, **When** they click the reset button, **Then** all segments are removed except one empty default segment
2. **Given** a user has search results displayed, **When** they reset the application, **Then** all results are cleared and the results section returns to initial state
3. **Given** a user clicks reset, **When** the operation completes, **Then** they receive visual confirmation that the reset was successful

### User Story 3 - Enhanced Visual Design and Accessibility (Priority: P3)

A user with visual impairments or working in various lighting conditions needs to easily read and interact with the application through improved contrast, spacing, and clean visual hierarchy.

**Why this priority**: Ensures accessibility compliance and improves usability for all users, though core functionality works without these enhancements.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards, checking spacing consistency across components, and validating visual hierarchy supports easy scanning.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with visual impairments accesses the app, **When** they view any interface element, **Then** text-background contrast meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 ratio minimum)
2. **Given** a user scans the interface, **When** they look for key actions, **Then** visual hierarchy clearly distinguishes primary actions from secondary elements
3. **Given** a user views the interface, **When** they examine spacing and layout, **Then** consistent spacing patterns create clear visual groupings and improve readability

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user rotates their device from portrait to landscape orientation?
- How does the interface handle very long words in the results grid on narrow screens?
- What occurs when a user attempts to reset while a search operation is in progress?
- What happens when the reset operation fails or is interrupted? (Resolved: Show error message and preserve current state)
- How does the app perform on devices with very small screens (below 320px)?
- What happens when users have accessibility settings like large text enabled?
- How does the system handle the maximum limit of 6 segments and prevent users from adding more?
- What occurs when users attempt to create segments longer than 15 characters?
- How does performance scale with maximum segment configurations (6 segments × 15 characters each)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display properly on mobile viewport sizes from 320px to 768px width without horizontal scrolling
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide touch targets of minimum 44px for all interactive elements to meet accessibility standards
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain minimum 16px font size for all text content on mobile devices for readability
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a reset/clear button positioned at the bottom of the segment form area that removes all segments except one empty default segment
- **FR-005**: System MUST clear all search results when the reset button is activated
- **FR-006**: System MUST adapt the word results grid layout with specific responsive behavior: single column below 640px, 2-3 columns for 640px-1024px, and 4+ columns above 1024px
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide visual confirmation when reset operation is completed
- **FR-008**: System MUST show error message and preserve current state if reset operation fails
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain text-background contrast ratios of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text
- **FR-010**: System MUST use consistent spacing patterns throughout the interface for visual hierarchy
- **FR-011**: System MUST ensure the interface responds appropriately to device orientation changes
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow users to create up to 6 word segments maximum for filtering operations
- **FR-013**: System MUST support segment lengths up to 15 characters to accommodate longer word patterns

### Key Entities

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-16

- Q: Should the reset button require confirmation to prevent accidental data loss? → A: Include confirmation dialog for user safety
- Q: What specific responsive breakpoints should be implemented beyond the 320px-768px range? → A: Focus on standard Tailwind breakpoints: 320px (mobile), 640px (small tablet), and 768px (tablet) as primary breakpoints with fluid scaling between
- Q: Should the reset functionality preserve any user preferences or settings? → A: Reset should only clear segments and results, preserving any app-level settings or preferences
- Q: Where should the reset button be positioned in the interface? → A: At the bottom of the segment form area, separate from the Filter button
- Q: How should the system handle reset operation failures? → A: Show error message and preserve current state (no changes made)
- Q: What are the updated segment constraints for the application? → A: Maximum 6 segments allowed (increased from 5), with individual segment lengths up to 15 characters (increased from 10)
- Q: How should the UI handle the new maximum segment limits? → A: Disable add segment button at 6 segments, validate segment length input at 15 character limit, provide clear feedback for constraint violations

## Assumptions

- Users expect mobile-first responsive design patterns common in modern web applications
- Touch targets follow standard iOS and Android accessibility guidelines (44px minimum)
- Font scaling follows web accessibility best practices for mobile readability
- Reset functionality should be easily discoverable but protected against accidental activation
- Visual design improvements enhance usability without disrupting existing user workflows
- The application will primarily be used on standard mobile devices and tablets within the specified viewport range
