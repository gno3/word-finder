# Implementation Plan: Mobile Responsiveness and UI Polish

**Branch**: `004-responsiveness-and-polish` | **Date**: October 16, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-responsiveness-and-polish/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Enhance the word finder application with comprehensive mobile responsiveness across 320px-768px viewports, implement a reset/clear functionality for improved user workflow, and polish the UI with accessibility-compliant design patterns. Focus on touch-friendly interfaces, readable typography, and clean visual hierarchy while maintaining existing functionality.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.9.3 with React 19.1.1
**Primary Dependencies**: React DOM 19.1.1, Vite 7.1.7, Tailwind CSS v4, ESLint 9.36.0  
**Storage**: Browser localStorage/sessionStorage for user preferences (no server-side storage needed)
**Testing**: Vite built-in testing capabilities, browser developer tools for responsive testing
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) on mobile, tablet, and desktop
**Project Type**: Single-page web application enhancement (React + TypeScript + Vite)
**Performance Goals**: <1s layout adaptation on orientation change, <2s reset operation, maintain current load performance
**Constraints**: WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 contrast ratios), 44px minimum touch targets, mobile-first responsive design
**Scale/Scope**: UI enhancement affecting all existing components, no new major features, focus on accessibility and mobile UX

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **Clean Code**: Architecture supports single responsibility principle, TypeScript types are explicit, reset functionality follows clear separation of concerns through dedicated useResetState hook
- [x] **Simple UX**: User workflows optimized for shortest path to completion, reset provides single clear action with confirmation, mobile interfaces simplified for touch interaction, visual hierarchy maintained
- [x] **Responsive Design**: Design specifically targets mobile, tablet, desktop with mobile-first approach, implements constitutional touch target requirements (44px minimum), WCAG AA compliance achieved
- [x] **Minimal Dependencies**: No new dependencies required - leverages existing Tailwind CSS v4, enhances current component structure, uses React hooks patterns already established
- [x] **Technology Stack**: Uses approved React 19.1.1+, TypeScript 5.9.3+, Vite 7.1.7+, Tailwind CSS v4 for styling (constitutional requirement), maintains existing ESLint configuration
- [x] **Performance Standards**: Bundle size unaffected (CSS-only changes), layout performance optimized for mobile (<1s orientation changes), efficient re-rendering patterns maintained, reset operations <2s

**Post-Design Validation**: All constitutional requirements maintained. Design enhances existing patterns without introducing complexity or dependencies. Responsive design aligns with constitutional mandates.

**Structure Decision**: Enhancement of existing component structure with minimal new files. Focus on improving existing WordFilter components for mobile responsiveness and adding reset functionality through a new custom hook. No major architectural changes required - leverages current React component hierarchy.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
