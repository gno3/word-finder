# Implementation Plan: WordSegmentInput Component

**Branch**: `003-create-a-wordsegmentinput` | **Date**: October 16, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-create-a-wordsegmentinput/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Enhance the existing WordSegmentInput component with comprehensive validation features including real-time validation, segment limits (maximum 5), character case normalization, segment length constraints (maximum 10), and improved error display. The component already exists at `src/components/WordFilter/SegmentInput.tsx` and needs validation enhancements to match the specification requirements.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.9.3 with React 19.1.1
**Primary Dependencies**: React DOM 19.1.1, Vite 7.1.7, Tailwind CSS (NEEDS CLARIFICATION: not currently installed), ESLint 9.36.0  
**Storage**: Component state management (React useState/hooks) - no persistent storage required
**Testing**: Vite built-in testing capabilities (additional frameworks require justification)
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
**Project Type**: Single-page web application (React + TypeScript + Vite)
**Performance Goals**: <1s validation response, real-time input validation, responsive UI
**Constraints**: Maximum 5 segments, maximum 10 characters per segment, responsive design required, accessibility compliance, input field height consistency (h-12/48px for visual alignment)
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user component, low complexity enhancement to existing component

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **Clean Code**: Enhancement maintains single responsibility, validation utilities are pure functions, TypeScript interfaces clearly defined
- [x] **Simple UX**: Real-time validation provides immediate feedback, error messages guide users to correct inputs, single primary action per field
- [x] **Responsive Design**: Design preserves mobile-first approach, Tailwind classes ensure cross-device compatibility
- [x] **Minimal Dependencies**: Only adds constitutionally-required Tailwind CSS, no additional external libraries
- [x] **Technology Stack**: Tailwind CSS installation planned in research phase, uses approved React 19.1.1+, TypeScript 5.9.3+, Vite 7.1.7+
- [x] **Performance Standards**: Real-time validation under 1s, useMemo for derived state, no unnecessary re-renders, bundle size impact minimal

```

**Structure Decision**: Enhancement of existing component structure. The SegmentInput component already exists and implements basic functionality. This feature will enhance validation capabilities, add real-time feedback, and implement the constraints specified in the requirements. No new major structural changes required - focus on enhancing existing SegmentInput.tsx component.

## UI Enhancement Documentation

**Field Layout**: Available Letters positioned left, Target Length positioned right for improved visual flow (left-to-right: input source → desired outcome)

**Icon Standards**: 
- Available Letters: Document icon with lines (represents text/letter content)
- Target Length: Hash/number symbol (# icon for numeric input clarity)

**Input Consistency**: All input fields maintain uniform height (h-12/48px) for visual alignment and professional appearance

**Help Text Optimization**: Simplified from "Pool of letters" to "Possible letters" for clearer, more concise user guidance

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No constitutional violations remain after Phase 1 design. Tailwind CSS installation addressed in research phase.
