## Research Tasks

### Task 1: Tailwind CSS Integration
**Question**: How to integrate Tailwind CSS into existing React + Vite project?

**Decision**: Install Tailwind CSS via npm and configure with Vite  
**Rationale**: Constitution mandates Tailwind CSS for styling. Vite has official Tailwind integration support. Minimal configuration required.  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Continue with inline CSS (rejected - violates constitution)
- Use CSS modules (rejected - constitution specifically requires Tailwind)
- Use styled-components (rejected - adds dependency, constitution requires Tailwind)

**Implementation approach**:
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

### Task 2: Real-time Validation Patterns
**Question**: Best practices for real-time input validation in React with TypeScript?

**Decision**: Use controlled inputs with onChange handlers and immediate validation  
**Rationale**: Provides instant feedback as required by specification. Prevents invalid state accumulation. Better UX than delayed validation.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Debounced validation (rejected - specification requires immediate feedback)
- onBlur validation (rejected - specification requires real-time)
- Form-level validation only (rejected - poor UX for individual fields)

**Implementation approach**:
- Validation functions in utils/validation.ts
- State management with useState for validation errors
- Conditional error display based on validation state

### Task 3: Component State Management for Multiple Segments
**Question**: How to manage state for dynamic list of segments with validation?

**Decision**: Use array state with individual validation tracking  
**Rationale**: React's useState can handle array updates efficiently. Each segment needs independent validation state. Simple and performant.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- useReducer for complex state (rejected - unnecessary complexity for this use case)
- External state management (rejected - violates minimal dependencies principle)
- Individual useState per segment (rejected - doesn't scale with dynamic segments)

**Implementation approach**:
```typescript
const [segments, setSegments] = useState<Segment[]>([defaultSegment]);
const [validationErrors, setValidationErrors] = useState<Record<number, string>>({});
```

### Task 4: Validation Rules Implementation
**Question**: How to implement the specific validation rules defined in requirements?

**Decision**: Create dedicated validation utility functions with clear error messages  
**Rationale**: Centralized validation logic ensures consistency. Pure functions are testable. Clear separation of concerns.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Inline validation in components (rejected - reduces reusability and testability)
- Schema validation library (rejected - adds dependency for simple rules)
- Regular expressions only (rejected - doesn't provide user-friendly error messages)

**Validation rules to implement**:
- Positive integer validation (1-10 range)
- Alphabetic character validation with case normalization
- Segment count validation (1-5 segments)
- Real-time error message generation

### Task 5: Total Length Display Logic
**Question**: How to efficiently calculate and display total word length?

**Decision**: Use useMemo hook to calculate derived state from segments array  
**Rationale**: Prevents unnecessary recalculations. React best practice for derived state. Automatically updates when segments change.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual calculation in render (rejected - inefficient, causes unnecessary renders)
- Separate state for total (rejected - can become out of sync with segments)
- useEffect to update total (rejected - useMemo is more appropriate for derived state)

**Implementation approach**:
```typescript
const totalLength = useMemo(() => 
  segments.reduce((sum, segment) => sum + segment.targetLength, 0), 
  [segments]
);
```

## Key Dependencies

**Existing Dependencies**: All required dependencies already available
- React 19.1.1 - Component framework
- TypeScript 5.9.3 - Type safety
- Existing validation utilities in utils/

**New Dependencies Required**:
- tailwindcss (dev dependency) - Required by constitution
- postcss (dev dependency) - Tailwind requirement  
- autoprefixer (dev dependency) - Tailwind requirement

## Integration Points

**Parent Components**: 
- WordFilterForm.tsx - Needs to handle validation state
- WordFilter.tsx - May need total length display integration

**Shared Utilities**:
- types/wordFilter.ts - May need validation interfaces
- utils/validation.ts - Extend with new validation functions

**Styling Migration**:
- Convert existing inline Tailwind classes to proper Tailwind setup
- Ensure responsive design maintained during migration

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: 
- Real-time validation implementation (standard React pattern)
- State management for segments (well-established patterns)
- Validation logic (straightforward business rules)

**Medium Risk**:
- Tailwind CSS migration (requires build configuration changes)
- Integration with existing validation utilities (potential conflicts)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Tailwind installation in development environment first
- Gradual migration of styles while maintaining existing functionality
- Comprehensive testing of validation integration points
