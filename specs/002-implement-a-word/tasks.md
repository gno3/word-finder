# Tasks: Word Filtering Algorithm

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-implement-a-word/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT required for this feature based on specification - focusing on implementation only.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **React web app**: `src/` for source code, `public/` for static assets
- Component organization: `src/components/`, `src/pages/`, `src/hooks/`
- TypeScript types: `src/types/`, services: `src/services/`, utilities: `src/utils/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure for word filtering feature

- [x] T001 Create TypeScript type definitions in src/types/wordFilter.ts for Segment, FilterResult, FilterError interfaces
- [x] T002 [P] Create base WordFilterService class structure in src/services/wordFilterService.ts with method signatures (implementation in T004-T005)
- [x] T003 [P] Create input validation utilities in src/utils/inputValidation.ts (validates segment structure, not letter usage)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T004 Implement core filtering algorithm logic in src/services/wordFilterService.ts (filterWords method)
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement segment validation logic in src/services/wordFilterService.ts (validateSegments method, uses T003 utilities)
- [ ] T006 [P] Implement letter usage validation with character frequency mapping in src/utils/letterValidation.ts (validates letter constraints)
- [ ] T007 [P] Implement word splitting utility in src/utils/wordSplitting.ts (splitWordIntoSegments function)
- [ ] T008 Create useWordFilter React hook in src/hooks/useWordFilter.ts integrating with existing useDictionary hook
- [ ] T009 Implement error handling and structured error creation utilities in src/utils/errorHandling.ts

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Basic Word Pattern Matching (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable users to filter dictionary words using simple segment patterns with 2-3 segments

**Independent Test**: Provide two-segment pattern (segment 1: letters "abc", length 2; segment 2: letters "def", length 3) and verify correctly filtered, alphabetically sorted dictionary words are returned

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Create SegmentInput component in src/components/WordFilter/SegmentInput.tsx for individual segment configuration
- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Create WordFilterForm component in src/components/WordFilter/WordFilterForm.tsx for segment collection and filter triggering
- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create FilterResults component in src/components/WordFilter/FilterResults.tsx for displaying filtered words
- [ ] T013 [US1] Create main WordFilter page component in src/components/WordFilter/WordFilter.tsx integrating form and results
- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement basic segment validation UI feedback in WordFilterForm component
- [ ] T015 [US1] Add responsive Tailwind CSS styling for mobile-first design in all WordFilter components
- [ ] T016 [US1] Integrate WordFilter component with existing App.tsx and routing structure
- [ ] T017 [US1] Implement error display component in src/components/WordFilter/ErrorDisplay.tsx for validation errors

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional with basic 2-3 segment filtering

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Complex Multi-Segment Filtering (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Handle complex patterns with 4+ segments and sophisticated constraint validation

**Independent Test**: Provide 4+ segment pattern with different letter sets and lengths, verify algorithm handles complex combinations without performance issues

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Enhance SegmentInput component in src/components/WordFilter/SegmentInput.tsx to support dynamic segment addition/removal (depends on T010)
- [ ] T019 [P] [US2] Create SegmentList component in src/components/WordFilter/SegmentList.tsx for managing multiple segments
- [ ] T020 [US2] Enhance WordFilterForm component to handle up to 10 segments with validation
- [ ] T021 [US2] Implement advanced validation logic for overlapping letter sets in src/utils/advancedValidation.ts
- [ ] T022 [US2] Add segment constraint preview functionality to show expected word length and complexity
- [ ] T023 [US2] Enhance error handling for complex patterns with detailed constraint violation messages
- [ ] T024 [US2] Add segment reordering functionality with drag-and-drop or button controls

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently with simple and complex patterns

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Performance-Optimized Large Dictionary Search (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Ensure responsive performance with large dictionaries and complex patterns under 500ms

**Independent Test**: Run algorithm against full SOWPODS dictionary (267,000+ words) with various segment patterns, measure response times under 500ms

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T025 [P] [US3] Implement performance monitoring in src/utils/performanceMonitoring.ts for response time tracking
- [ ] T026 [P] [US3] Create PerformanceMetrics component in src/components/WordFilter/PerformanceMetrics.tsx for displaying timing data
- [ ] T027 [US3] Optimize filtering algorithm with early termination and length pre-filtering in wordFilterService.ts
- [ ] T028 [US3] Implement result pagination in src/components/WordFilter/PaginatedResults.tsx for large result sets
- [ ] T029 [US3] Add progress indicator component in src/components/WordFilter/FilterProgress.tsx for long-running operations
- [ ] T030 [US3] Implement concurrent filtering protection to prevent multiple simultaneous operations
- [ ] T031 [US3] Add performance benchmarking with different dictionary sizes and segment complexities
- [ ] T032 [US3] Optimize memory usage during filtering operations with streaming results

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional with optimal performance

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories and final integration

- [ ] T033 [P] Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation) to all WordFilter components
- [ ] T034 [P] Implement result export functionality in src/components/WordFilter/ExportResults.tsx
- [ ] T035 [P] Add input persistence using localStorage for segment configurations
- [ ] T036 [P] Create comprehensive example patterns in src/data/examplePatterns.ts for user guidance
- [ ] T037 Code cleanup and refactoring across all WordFilter components
- [ ] T038 [P] Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation to all service methods and utilities
- [ ] T039 Performance optimization review and bundle size analysis
- [ ] T040 Run quickstart.md validation and update documentation with final implementation details

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances US1 components but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Optimizes US1/US2 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Component creation before integration
- Core functionality before UI enhancements
- Basic implementation before performance optimization
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Components within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create SegmentInput component in src/components/WordFilter/SegmentInput.tsx"
Task: "Create WordFilterForm component in src/components/WordFilter/WordFilterForm.tsx"
Task: "Create FilterResults component in src/components/WordFilter/FilterResults.tsx"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch all enhancements for User Story 2 together:
Task: "Enhance SegmentInput component for dynamic segment management"
Task: "Create SegmentList component for multiple segment handling"
Task: "Implement advanced validation logic for overlapping letter sets"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently with simple 2-3 segment patterns
5. Deploy/demo basic word filtering functionality

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP with basic filtering!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Advanced multi-segment filtering)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Performance-optimized filtering)
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Basic filtering)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Complex patterns)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Performance optimization)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
