# Implementation Plan: Word Filtering Algorithm

**Branch**: `002-implement-a-word` | **Date**: 2025-10-16 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-implement-a-word/spec.md`

**Note**: This template has been filled by the `/speckit.plan` command execution completed on 2025-10-16. Planning phases 0-1 complete.

## Summary

Implement a word filtering algorithm that takes an ordered array of segments (each with available letters and target length) and returns matching dictionary words that satisfy all segment constraints. The algorithm uses strict one-to-one letter mapping within segments, processes input in canonical lowercase, and returns alphabetically sorted results as a pure function without logging.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.9.3 with React 19.1.1
**Primary Dependencies**: React DOM 19.1.1, Vite 7.1.7, Tailwind CSS, ESLint 9.36.0  
**Storage**: Leverages existing dictionary service from feature 001 (no additional storage required)
**Testing**: Vite built-in testing capabilities (additional frameworks require justification)
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
**Project Type**: Single-page web application (React + TypeScript + Vite)
**Performance Goals**: <3s initial load, <200ms interaction response, bundle size <500KB gzipped
**Constraints**: Responsive design required, minimal dependencies principle, accessibility compliance
**Scale/Scope**: Dictionary processing (267K+ words), segment arrays up to 10 elements, <500ms response time, web application usage

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **Clean Code**: Architecture supports single responsibility principle, TypeScript types are explicit
- [x] **Simple UX**: User workflows are optimized for shortest path to completion, single primary action per screen
- [x] **Responsive Design**: Design works on mobile, tablet, desktop with mobile-first approach
- [x] **Minimal Dependencies**: Each new dependency justified by significant value, bundle size impact assessed
- [x] **Technology Stack**: Uses approved React 19.1.1+, TypeScript 5.9.3+, Vite 7.1.7+ versions, Tailwind CSS for styling
- [x] **Performance Standards**: Bundle size monitoring planned, lazy loading considered where appropriate

**Structure Decision**: Standard React + TypeScript + Vite web application structure using existing directory layout with feature-specific components for word filtering algorithm integration.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No violations identified. The word filtering algorithm implementation:
- Maintains clean code principles with single responsibility functions
- Provides simple UX with clear segment-based input and results display  
- Uses responsive design with Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Adds no new external dependencies beyond approved technology stack
- Follows established React + TypeScript + Vite patterns
- Meets performance standards with <500ms response time targets
