## Notes

âœ… **VALIDATION PASSED**: All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

**Validation Details**:
- Content Quality: Specification focuses on what users need and why, without technical implementation details
- Requirements: All 9 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous with clear acceptance criteria
- Success Criteria: All 7 criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- User Scenarios: 3 prioritized user stories with independent test descriptions and clear acceptance scenarios
- Edge Cases: 7 comprehensive edge cases identified covering boundary conditions and error scenarios
- Scope: Feature scope is clearly bounded to word filtering algorithm with segment-based constraints
