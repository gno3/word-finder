# Feature Specification: Word Filtering Algorithm

**Feature Branch**: `002-implement-a-word`  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement a word filtering algorithm that takes an array of ordered segments (each with available letters and number of letters to use) and returns matching words from the dictionary that are words that satisfy the submitted letters and segment length for each ordered segement and sorted alphabetically"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Word Pattern Matching (Priority: P1)

A user provides a sequence of letter constraints (like puzzle pieces) and wants to find all dictionary words that can be formed by combining segments that match each constraint in order.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables word puzzle solving and pattern-based word discovery, delivering immediate value for word game enthusiasts and puzzle solvers.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing a simple two-segment pattern (e.g., segment 1: letters "abc", length 2; segment 2: letters "def", length 3) and verifying the algorithm returns correctly filtered and sorted dictionary words.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user provides segments with available letters and target lengths, **When** the algorithm processes the request, **Then** all returned words match the exact segment constraints in order
2. **Given** valid segment constraints exist, **When** the algorithm executes, **Then** results are returned sorted alphabetically
3. **Given** segment constraints that match multiple words, **When** filtering is applied, **Then** all valid combinations are included in results

### User Story 2 - Complex Multi-Segment Filtering (Priority: P2)

A user provides complex multi-segment patterns with varying letters and lengths to find words that satisfy sophisticated constraints, enabling advanced word puzzle solving.

**Why this priority**: Extends the basic functionality to handle real-world complexity of word puzzles and games with multiple constraints, increasing utility for advanced users.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing a 4+ segment pattern with different letter sets and lengths, verifying the algorithm correctly handles complex combinations and constraint validation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple segments with different letter constraints, **When** the algorithm processes them, **Then** each segment's letters and length requirements are independently validated
2. **Given** segments that heavily restrict possible matches, **When** filtering is applied, **Then** the algorithm efficiently handles edge cases without performance degradation
3. **Given** overlapping letter sets across segments, **When** processing occurs, **Then** the algorithm correctly distinguishes between segment-specific letter usage

---

### User Story 3 - Performance-Optimized Large Dictionary Search (Priority: P3)

A user performs word filtering operations on large dictionaries with minimal latency, ensuring the tool remains responsive for real-time puzzle solving and interactive word games.

**Why this priority**: Ensures the algorithm scales well with large dictionaries and complex patterns, maintaining good user experience for demanding use cases.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the algorithm against the full SOWPODS dictionary (267,000+ words) with various segment patterns and measuring response times under 500ms.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the full dictionary is loaded, **When** complex segment filtering is requested, **Then** results are returned within acceptable time limits
2. **Given** multiple concurrent filtering requests, **When** processing occurs, **Then** the algorithm maintains consistent performance
3. **Given** extremely restrictive constraints that yield few results, **When** filtering completes, **Then** the algorithm terminates efficiently without unnecessary processing

### Edge Cases

- What happens when segment constraints are impossible to satisfy (no matching words exist)? → System returns informative error message detailing which specific constraints could not be satisfied
- How does the system handle segments with duplicate letters or overlapping letter sets? → Each letter in the segment must be used exactly once with strict one-to-one mapping
- What occurs when a segment specifies zero available letters or zero target length? → System returns validation error with specific details about the invalid constraint
- How does the algorithm behave when segments are provided in different orders?
- What happens when the same letter appears in multiple segments' available letters?
- How does the system handle very long words that exceed typical segment combinations?
- What occurs when segment length requirements exceed the available letters count?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept an ordered array of segments where each segment contains available letters and a target length constraint
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate that each segment in the input array has both available letters and a positive integer length, returning validation errors with specific constraint details for invalid inputs
- **FR-003**: System MUST filter dictionary words to find only those that can be constructed by concatenating segments in the specified order
- **FR-004**: System MUST verify that each segment of a candidate word uses only letters from that segment's available letters set with strict one-to-one mapping (each provided letter used exactly once)
- **FR-005**: System MUST verify that each segment of a candidate word matches exactly the specified length for that segment
- **FR-006**: System MUST return results sorted alphabetically in ascending order
- **FR-007**: System MUST return an empty array when no dictionary words satisfy the provided constraints, accompanied by an informative error message detailing which constraints could not be satisfied
- **FR-008**: System MUST process segments in the exact order provided without reordering or optimization that changes sequence
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle letter case consistently by converting all input to the dictionary's canonical case (typically lowercase) before processing
- **FR-010**: System MUST implement the algorithm as a pure function without internal logging or side effects to maintain functional programming principles

### Key Entities

- **Segment**: A constraint specification containing available letters (string) and target length (integer)
- **Word Pattern**: The complete sequence of segments that defines the filtering criteria
- **Filtered Result**: A dictionary word that satisfies all segment constraints when split according to the pattern
- **Letter Set**: The collection of available characters for a specific segment position

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Algorithm returns results for valid segment patterns within 500 milliseconds when processing the full dictionary
- **SC-002**: All returned words can be mathematically verified to satisfy every segment constraint when split in order
- **SC-003**: Results are consistently sorted in alphabetical order across all input variations
- **SC-004**: Algorithm handles edge cases (empty results, invalid constraints) without errors or crashes
- **SC-005**: System processes segment arrays with up to 10 segments without performance degradation
- **SC-006**: Algorithm correctly identifies 100% of valid dictionary words that match the provided constraints (no false negatives)
- **SC-007**: Algorithm returns 0% invalid words in results (no false positives)

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-15

- Q: When segment constraints cannot be satisfied (no matching words exist), what should the algorithm return? → A: Return informative error with constraint details explaining why no matches were found
- Q: How should letter usage be handled within individual segments? → A: Letters must be used exactly as provided (strict one-to-one mapping)
- Q: How should the system handle invalid segment inputs (zero letters, zero length, etc.)? → A: Return validation error with specific constraint details
- Q: How should the algorithm handle mixed case input in segment letters? → A: Process using dictionary's canonical case (typically lowercase)
- Q: What observability should be implemented for debugging and performance monitoring? → A: No logging - keep algorithm purely functional
