# Research: Word Filtering Algorithm

**Date**: 2025-10-16  
**Purpose**: Research optimal algorithms and patterns for segment-based word filtering

## Algorithm Design Research

### Decision: Segment-Based Dictionary Filtering with Early Termination
**Rationale**: Given the constraints of strict one-to-one letter mapping and exact length matching, a segment-by-segment validation approach with early termination provides optimal performance. The algorithm should iterate through dictionary words, split each word into segments matching the pattern lengths, and validate each segment independently.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Brute force permutation generation: Rejected due to exponential complexity
- Trie-based prefix matching: Rejected due to complexity of multi-segment constraints
- Hash-based pre-filtering: Considered but unnecessary given existing dictionary service performance

### Decision: Pure Function Architecture with Immutable Data
**Rationale**: Specification requires pure function implementation without logging. This aligns with functional programming principles and makes the algorithm easily testable and predictable.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Class-based approach with internal state: Rejected due to pure function requirement
- Service class with methods: Rejected to maintain functional programming paradigm

## Performance Optimization Research

### Decision: Early Termination and Length Pre-filtering
**Rationale**: Filter dictionary words by total length before segment validation to reduce unnecessary processing. Use early termination when any segment fails validation.

**Implementation approach**:
1. Calculate total expected word length from segments
2. Filter dictionary by exact length match
3. For each candidate word, split into segments by cumulative lengths
4. Validate each segment with early termination on first failure

### Decision: Letter Usage Validation with Character Counting
**Rationale**: For strict one-to-one mapping, implement character frequency counting to ensure each letter in the segment is used exactly once from the available letters.

**Algorithm**:
1. Create character frequency map from available letters
2. For each character in word segment, decrement from frequency map
3. If any character goes negative or is not available, reject word
4. After processing, all frequencies should be zero for exact usage

## Integration with Existing Dictionary Service

### Decision: Extend Existing DictionaryService
**Rationale**: The existing dictionary loading utility (feature 001) provides optimized dictionary access with binary search and caching. The filtering algorithm should integrate seamlessly with this service.

**Integration points**:
- Use existing dictionary loading and caching mechanisms
- Leverage existing word validation patterns
- Maintain consistent error handling approach

### Decision: New Hook for Word Filtering
**Rationale**: Create a new React hook `useWordFilter` that depends on the existing `useDictionary` hook, maintaining separation of concerns.

**Interface design**:
```typescript
interface UseWordFilterResult {
  filterWords: (segments: Segment[]) => FilterResult;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}
```

## TypeScript Type System Research

### Decision: Strict Type Definitions with Runtime Validation
**Rationale**: Implement comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures with runtime validation to ensure type safety and early error detection.

**Type hierarchy**:
```typescript
interface Segment {
  availableLetters: string;
  targetLength: number;
}

interface FilterResult {
  words: string[];
  error?: string;
}

interface ValidationError {
  message: string;
  segmentIndex?: number;
  constraint: string;
}
```

## Testing Strategy Research

### Decision: Unit Tests with Comprehensive Edge Case Coverage
**Rationale**: Pure function implementation enables straightforward unit testing. Focus on edge cases identified in specification including empty results, invalid inputs, and performance boundaries.

**Test categories**:
1. Basic functionality tests (simple 2-segment patterns)
2. Complex multi-segment validation
3. Edge case handling (empty results, invalid inputs)
4. Performance tests (large dictionary, complex patterns)
5. Error message validation

### Decision: Test Data Generation with Known Results
**Rationale**: Create controlled test datasets with predictable outcomes to ensure algorithm correctness without dependence on external dictionary changes.

**Test data approach**:
- Small controlled dictionary for unit tests
- Known word patterns with expected results
- Edge case scenarios with expected error messages

## Error Handling Research

### Decision: Structured Error Objects with Detailed Context
**Rationale**: Specification requires informative error messages with constraint details. Implement structured error objects that provide specific information about which constraints failed.

**Error structure**:
```typescript
interface FilterError {
  type: 'validation' | 'constraint' | 'processing';
  message: string;
  details: {
    segmentIndex?: number;
    constraint?: string;
    providedValue?: any;
  };
}
```

## Performance Benchmarking Research

### Decision: Performance Testing with Real Dictionary
**Rationale**: Given the 500ms response time requirement and 267K+ word dictionary, implement performance monitoring to ensure specification compliance.

**Benchmarking approach**:
- Test with full SOWPODS dictionary
- Measure response times for various segment complexity levels
- Monitor memory usage during filtering operations
- Establish performance regression tests

**Performance targets**:
- Simple patterns (2-3 segments): <100ms
- Complex patterns (4-6 segments): <300ms  
- Maximum complexity (7-10 segments): <500ms
