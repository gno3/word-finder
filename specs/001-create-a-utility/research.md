# Research: Dictionary Loading Utility

**Date**: 2025-10-15  
**Feature**: Dictionary Loading Utility  
**Phase**: 0 - Technical Research

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. Browser localStorage Best Practices for Large Data

**Decision**: Use localStorage with chunking strategy and size monitoring

**Rationale**: 
- localStorage has 5-10MB limit across browsers, sufficient for 5MB dictionary
- Synchronous API is simpler than IndexedDB for this use case
- Good browser support across all target browsers
- Persistent across sessions unlike sessionStorage

**Alternatives considered**:
- IndexedDB: Overkill for simple key-value storage, async complexity not needed
- sessionStorage: Loses data when tab closes, violates offline requirement
- In-memory cache: Lost on page refresh, doesn't support persistence

### 2. Exponential Backoff Implementation Patterns

**Decision**: Implement custom exponential backoff with jitter

**Rationale**:
- Standard pattern: initial delay 1s, multiply by 2, max 8s delay
- Add jitter (random factor) to prevent thundering herd
- 3 retries maximum as specified in requirements
- Simple to implement without external dependencies

**Alternatives considered**:
- External retry library: Violates minimal dependencies principle
- Linear backoff: Less effective for temporary network issues
- Fixed delay: Can overwhelm servers during outages

### 3. Text File Validation Strategies

**Decision**: Implement simple format validation with regex patterns

**Rationale**:
- Validate content is UTF-8 text with newline-separated words
- Check for reasonable word patterns (alphabetic characters, length limits)
- Reject binary data or malformed content early
- Performance-focused validation (streaming if needed)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Complex NLP validation: Overkill for basic format checking
- Dictionary-specific validation: No standard dictionary format specified
- No validation: Security and reliability risk

### 4. React Hook State Management Patterns

**Decision**: Use useReducer for complex loading state management

**Rationale**:
- Multiple states: idle, loading, loaded, error, cached
- State transitions are complex (retry logic, fallbacks)
- useReducer provides predictable state updates
- Better testability than multiple useState calls

**Alternatives considered**:
- Multiple useState: Harder to manage state consistency
- External state library: Violates minimal dependencies principle
- Context API: Unnecessary complexity for single feature

### 5. Error Handling and User Feedback Strategies

**Decision**: Implement progressive disclosure of error information

**Rationale**:
- Simple loading indicators for normal operation
- Detailed error messages only when needed
- Graceful degradation to cached data
- User-friendly retry mechanisms

**Alternatives considered**:
- Silent failures: Poor user experience
- Verbose error logging: May overwhelm users
- No retry capability: Reduces reliability

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Single responsibility: Each module handles one concern
- TypeScript strict mode: Explicit types for all interfaces
- Pure functions where possible for testability
- Clear separation between service layer and React integration

### Performance Considerations
- Non-blocking UI during dictionary loading
- Chunked processing for large files if needed
- Efficient string array operations for lookups
- Memory-conscious parsing (avoid duplication)

### Error Recovery
- Graceful fallback to cached data
- User-actionable error messages
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Network status awareness

## Technical Constraints Identified

1. **Browser Storage Limits**: 5MB dictionary fits within typical localStorage quotas
2. **Network Reliability**: Requires robust retry and fallback mechanisms
3. **Performance**: Must not block UI thread during processing
4. **Memory Usage**: Large string arrays require careful memory management
5. **Type Safety**: All operations must be type-safe at compile time
