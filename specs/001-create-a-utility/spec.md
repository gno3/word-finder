# Feature Specification: Dictionary Loading Utility

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-utility`  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a utility function to fetch and parse the dictionary text file from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesstess/Scrabble/master/scrabble/sowpods.txt on app load"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Application Startup with Dictionary Loading (Priority: P1)

The application automatically loads a comprehensive word dictionary when it starts up, providing users with immediate access to word lookup functionality without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: This is foundational infrastructure that enables all word-finding features. Without the dictionary loaded, the core application functionality cannot work.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by launching the application and verifying that words are available for lookup within 3 seconds of app start, delivering the core value of having a populated word database.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user opens the application for the first time, **When** the app loads, **Then** the dictionary is automatically fetched and parsed in the background
2. **Given** the dictionary is successfully loaded, **When** a user attempts to search for a common word, **Then** the word is found in the loaded dictionary
3. **Given** the application starts, **When** the dictionary loading completes, **Then** users can immediately begin using word-finding features

### User Story 2 - Offline Dictionary Access (Priority: P2)

Users can access previously loaded dictionary data even when their internet connection is unavailable, ensuring consistent app functionality.

**Why this priority**: Provides enhanced user experience by maintaining functionality during network interruptions, but not critical for initial app functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by loading the dictionary once, disconnecting from internet, restarting the app, and verifying word lookup still works.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the dictionary was previously loaded successfully, **When** the user launches the app without internet, **Then** the cached dictionary data is used
2. **Given** cached dictionary data exists, **When** network is unavailable, **Then** word lookup features continue to function normally

---

### User Story 3 - Dictionary Update Handling (Priority: P3)

The application gracefully handles scenarios where the dictionary source is updated or temporarily unavailable, maintaining service continuity.

**Why this priority**: Improves long-term reliability but doesn't affect core functionality for most usage scenarios.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating network failures or source URL changes and verifying the app continues to work with existing data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the dictionary source URL is temporarily unavailable, **When** the app loads, **Then** users see a helpful message and can retry loading
2. **Given** a network error occurs during dictionary fetching, **When** the app detects the failure, **Then** fallback behavior is triggered to maintain app functionality

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the dictionary URL returns a 404 or other HTTP error?
- How does the system handle partial downloads or corrupted dictionary data?
- What occurs when the dictionary file format changes unexpectedly?
- How does the app behave when the dictionary file is extremely large and takes a long time to download?
- What happens when the user's device has very limited storage space?
- What occurs when the dictionary file exceeds the 5MB size limit?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically fetch the dictionary file from the specified URL when the application loads
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse the downloaded text file into a string array with one word per line for efficient lookups
- **FR-003**: System MUST cache the dictionary data in browser localStorage to enable persistent offline access across sessions
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide feedback to users about dictionary loading status (loading, success, error)
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle network errors gracefully by retrying up to 3 times with exponential backoff without crashing the application
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate downloaded data contains alphabetic words separated by newlines and reject files with binary or malformed content
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow the application to function with previously cached data when new downloads fail
- **FR-008**: System MUST complete dictionary loading within a reasonable timeframe to avoid blocking user interface
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle dictionary files up to 5MB in size and reject larger files with appropriate error messaging

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Dictionary**: A string array containing words parsed from the remote text file, with one word per line format
- **Dictionary Entry**: Individual words stored as plain text strings without additional metadata
- **Loading State**: Status information about the dictionary fetching process (loading, loaded, error, cached)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Dictionary loading completes within 5 seconds on a standard internet connection (50 Mbps)
- **SC-002**: Word lookup operations return results in under 100 milliseconds after dictionary is loaded  
- **SC-003**: Application remains responsive during dictionary loading with loading indicators visible
- **SC-004**: 99% of dictionary loading attempts succeed when internet connectivity is available
- **SC-005**: Application successfully falls back to cached dictionary data when network is unavailable
- **SC-006**: Dictionary data persists across application restarts without requiring re-download

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-15

- Q: What storage mechanism should be used for local dictionary caching? → A: Browser localStorage (persistent across sessions)
- Q: What internal data structure format should be used for parsed dictionary data? → A: Plain text with one word per line (simple string array)
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable dictionary file size for storage and performance? → A: 5MB (comprehensive dictionary, reasonable size)
- Q: What retry strategy should be used for failed dictionary downloads? → A: Retry 3 times with exponential backoff
- Q: What validation should be performed on downloaded dictionary content? → A: Text format validation only
