# Implementation Plan: Dictionary Loading Utility

**Branch**: `001-create-a-utility` | **Date**: 2025-10-15 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-create-a-utility/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Create a utility function that automatically fetches and parses a dictionary text file from a remote URL during application startup. The utility will cache dictionary data in browser localStorage for offline access, implement retry logic with exponential backoff for network resilience, and validate content format. Technical approach focuses on clean separation of concerns with a dedicated dictionary service, loading state management, and non-blocking UI implementation using React hooks and TypeScript for type safety.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.9.3 with React 19.1.1
**Primary Dependencies**: React DOM 19.1.1, Vite 7.1.7, Tailwind CSS, ESLint 9.36.0  
**Storage**: Browser localStorage for dictionary caching (up to 5MB)
**Testing**: Vite built-in testing capabilities (additional frameworks require justification)
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
**Project Type**: Single-page web application (React + TypeScript + Vite)
**Performance Goals**: <5s dictionary load, <100ms word lookup, <200ms interaction response, bundle size <500KB gzipped
**Constraints**: Responsive design required, minimal dependencies principle, accessibility compliance
**Scale/Scope**: Single dictionary file (~5MB), word lookup utility for word-finding features

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **Clean Code**: Architecture supports single responsibility principle with dedicated dictionary service, TypeScript types are explicit for all interfaces
- [x] **Simple UX**: User workflows optimized for automatic loading with minimal user intervention, clear loading feedback
- [x] **Responsive Design**: Dictionary service works on all devices, loading indicators adapt to screen sizes
- [x] **Minimal Dependencies**: No external dependencies required beyond existing React/TypeScript stack, uses native fetch API
- [x] **Technology Stack**: Uses approved React 19.1.1+, TypeScript 5.9.3+, Vite 7.1.7+ versions, Tailwind CSS for styling
- [x] **Performance Standards**: Bundle size impact minimal (utility function), lazy loading not applicable for core infrastructure

**Post-Design Review**: ✅ All constitutional requirements maintained through design phase. Service-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns aligns with clean code principles. Simple API surface minimizes complexity. No additional dependencies introduced.

```

**Structure Decision**: Selected utility-focused structure with clear separation of concerns - service layer for data operations, custom React hook for state management, utility modules for cross-cutting concerns (storage, validation, retry logic), and TypeScript types for strong typing. This aligns with the constitution's clean code and single responsibility principles while keeping the footprint minimal.
