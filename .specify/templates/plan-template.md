# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.9.3 with React 19.1.1
**Primary Dependencies**: React DOM 19.1.1, Vite 7.1.7, ESLint 9.36.0  
**Storage**: Browser localStorage/sessionStorage or external API (specify if applicable)
**Testing**: Vite built-in testing capabilities (additional frameworks require justification)
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
**Project Type**: Single-page web application (React + TypeScript + Vite)
**Performance Goals**: <3s initial load, <200ms interaction response, bundle size <500KB gzipped
**Constraints**: Responsive design required, minimal dependencies principle, accessibility compliance
**Scale/Scope**: [Specify expected user count, feature complexity, data volume as applicable]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] **Clean Code**: Architecture supports single responsibility principle, TypeScript types are explicit
- [ ] **Simple UX**: User workflows are optimized for shortest path to completion, single primary action per screen
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Design works on mobile, tablet, desktop with mobile-first approach
- [ ] **Minimal Dependencies**: Each new dependency justified by significant value, bundle size impact assessed
- [ ] **Technology Stack**: Uses approved React 19.1.1+, TypeScript 5.9.3+, Vite 7.1.7+ versions
- [ ] **Performance Standards**: Bundle size monitoring planned, lazy loading considered where appropriate

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
