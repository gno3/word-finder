# Word Finder Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clean Code (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Code MUST be readable, maintainable, and self-documenting. Every function, component, and module MUST have a single, clear responsibility. Variable and function names MUST describe their purpose without requiring comments. Complex logic MUST be broken down into smaller, testable units. TypeScript types MUST be explicit and comprehensive to catch errors at compile time.

*Rationale: Clean code reduces bugs, speeds up development, and ensures the project remains maintainable as it grows.*

### II. Simple UX
User interfaces MUST prioritize clarity and ease of use over visual complexity. Each screen or component MUST have one primary action. Navigation MUST be intuitive without requiring documentation. Loading states, error messages, and feedback MUST be clear and helpful. User workflows MUST be optimized for the shortest path to task completion.

*Rationale: Simple UX increases user adoption and reduces support burden while making the application accessible to a broader audience.*

### III. Responsive Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All components MUST work seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. CSS MUST use mobile-first design principles. Touch targets MUST meet accessibility standards (minimum 44px). Text MUST remain readable at all viewport sizes. Layout MUST adapt gracefully without horizontal scrolling on any device.

*Rationale: Modern web applications must work on all devices. Responsive design is not optional in today's multi-device environment.*

### IV. Minimal Dependencies
External dependencies MUST be justified by significant value addition. Each new dependency MUST be evaluated for bundle size impact, maintenance burden, and security implications. Functionality that can be implemented simply in-house MUST NOT use external libraries. Dependencies MUST be actively maintained with recent updates and good security records.

*Rationale: Fewer dependencies mean smaller bundle sizes, fewer security vulnerabilities, less maintenance overhead, and better long-term stability.*

## Technology Stack

**Framework**: React 19.1.1+ with TypeScript 5.9.3+
**Build Tool**: Vite 7.1.7+ for fast development and optimized production builds
**Styling**: CSS Modules or native CSS features (no CSS-in-JS libraries unless justified)
**State Management**: React built-in state management (useState, useReducer, Context) - external state libraries require justification
**Testing**: Vite's built-in testing capabilities - additional testing frameworks require justification
**Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript support as configured in eslint.config.js

*Technology choices MUST align with package.json versions. Upgrades require constitutional review if they introduce breaking changes to development workflow.*

## Development Standards

**File Organization**: Components in logical feature folders, shared utilities in dedicated modules, clear separation of concerns
**Component Structure**: Functional components with hooks, props interfaces defined with TypeScript, clear component lifecycle management
**Performance**: Bundle size monitoring, lazy loading for route-based code splitting, image optimization, efficient re-rendering patterns
**Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support, color contrast compliance
**Browser Support**: Modern evergreen browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) - IE support not required

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices and style guides. All pull requests MUST verify compliance with these principles. Violations MUST be justified in writing with specific rationale. New features MUST demonstrate adherence to all four core principles before implementation begins.

Amendments require documentation of impact, migration plan for existing code, and approval from project maintainers. Breaking changes to technology stack require constitutional amendment process.
